# Software-Test-Automation-Engineer-HW

This is the updated and reworked version of the MINDBODY Software Test Automation Engineer Assignment.  I have added the ChromeWebDriver package so that it elimenates the need for a physical copy of WebDriver.exe.

Tests 2 and 7 should run smoothly.  The solution was also normalized to help with code repatition and to make the code more efficient.

Please make sure that the NuGet packages restore upon build, if they do not you should be able to restore them through Visual Studio.
