# Software-Test-Automation-Engineer-HW

This is the updated and reworked version of the MINDBODY Software Test Automation Engineer Assignment.  I have added the ChromeWebDriver package so that it elimenates the need for a physical copy of WebDriver.exe.

Tests 2 and 7 should run smoothly.  The solution was also normalized to help with code repatition and to make the code more efficient.
